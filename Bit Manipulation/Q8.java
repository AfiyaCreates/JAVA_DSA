//if every no appears 3 times (odd times)..but single no appears once ...findt that no 
//arr= {2,2,3,2,7,7,8,7,8,8}
//see ss
//since every no appears 3 times ....their set bits will also appear 3 times ....if 3 was  not there in array the no in arr(bits) would be a power 0f 3
//so take modulo of arr with 3 = the remainder will be the extra (single time appearing no)....3(0011)
