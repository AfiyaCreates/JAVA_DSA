// base 2 number systems - binary no systems (with base 2)
//using 0 and 1 
//bitwise operators- and or not 
//and - when u add 1 with any no the digits remain same ...eg - 100110 + 111111 = 100110
//or -  even if 1 ise true then its true ...see table  in ss
//xor -(exclusive or )(if and ony if)- only one should be true
//any no xor with 1 = is complement of that no 
//no xor with 0 is no itself
//no xor with no = ans is 0 (nothing exclusove)
//complement
//left shift - <<
//a<<1 = 2a (any no double shifts by 1 is double of that no)
//in general - a<<b = a * 2^b
//right shift- >>
//a>>b - a/2^b

//remember in left shift ...remove left most bit and add 0 on rhs
//in right shift ...remove right most bit and add 0 on lhs

//leading 0 are ignored in all tpe of no systems 



//number systems 
//bianry - base 2 - 0 1
//decimal - base 10 - 0 to 9
//octal - base 7 - 0 to 8..means octal can include 11,12,...17,20 not 18..
//hexadecimal - base 16 - 0 to 9 and A to F

//number system conversion 
//decimal to base b - keep dividing by base ..take remainders and write it in opposite
//base b to decimal - multiply and add power of base with digits ..see coa notes or gate smashers for detail
