//errors are non recoverable 
//exception - something that prevents the normal flow of a program...eg dividing by zero,null point exception in java
// we can recover from func ..program can handle it
// throwable - class that handles exception
//check ss
//object class has throwable - which has exceptions and errors - errors are of two types ...checked and uncheceked 
//checked exceptions can be checked during compiler time ...but uncheceked exceptions can only be detected when the program is running ..at runtime
