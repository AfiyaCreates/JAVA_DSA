//wrapping up the implementation of data members and methods inside a class...hides the data into single entity to protect it from the outside world
// abstraction- hiding unnecessary details but only showing the essential info
// abstraction vs encapsulation- abstraction is a design level issue while encapsulation is an implementational level issue
//abstraction focuses on external stuff while encapsulation focuses on internal stuff
// abstraction is a process of gaining info while encapsulation is a process of containing info 
// write proper difference see on gfg ..notes etc 
// encxapsule(capsule - means inside task ..remeber like this)
// data hiding - focuses on security ...eg using private 
// encapsulation - focuses on hiding complex info ]...use of getters and setters isin encapsiulation
