//see ss
//String- is class...everything that starts with a capital letter is a class in java
//every string that we create is an obj of type string
//string a = "afiya khan".....string b = "afiya khan"...then both a and b in stack will point to a pool in heap which contains the name afiya khan
//the pool is used to create a separate portin in heap which store similar elements 
// a special part of memory that is set aside to hold String literals.
//strings are immutable ..its obj value cannot change...renaming creates a new obj
// strings are not mutable bcoz of security reasons
